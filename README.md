# Fibonacci Checker

This Python program calculates the nth Fibonacci number and checks if a given number is part of the Fibonacci sequence. It includes efficient computation, input validation, and a mathematical approach to verify Fibonacci numbers.

## Features

- **Efficient Calculation**: Computes the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the input is a non-negative integer.
- **Fibonacci Number Check**: Determines if a given number is part of the Fibonacci sequence.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fibonacci-checker.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd fibonacci-checker
    ```

3. **Run the program:**

    Execute the script using Python.

    ```bash
    python fibonacci_checker.py
    ```

4. **Follow the prompts** to input a non-negative number to calculate the Fibonacci number and check if it belongs to the Fibonacci sequence.

## Example

```bash
Enter a non-negative number > 10
Fibonacci(10) = 55
10 is not a Fibonacci number.

Enter a non-negative number > 8
Fibonacci(8) = 21
8 is a Fibonacci number.
```
This shows how the program responds to different inputs, illustrating both the calculation of the Fibonacci number and the check to see if the input itself is a Fibonacci number.

## Comments
This program is designed to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers and verify if a given number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence. It's a useful tool for anyone learning about Fibonacci sequences or working with related problems.
